### now

I'm a researcher, writer and linguist based in Berlin, Germany, and working internationally. My work focuses on the intersection of power, technology and information, in pursuit of social justice.

I currently work on Research and Engagement at [The Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/), an international non-profit organisation supporting civil society to use tech and data more effectively. This year, I'm a Visiting Fellow with [digitalHKS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/digitalhks/home) at the Harvard Kennedy School, an initiative that aims to educate public leaders about digital technology and about how that technology is fundamentally changing leadership, politics, and governing. I sit on the Advisory Committee of [CREA](http://www.creaworld.org/), a feminist human rights organisation based in India, working to advance the rights of women and girls, and the sexual and reproductive freedoms of all people. I'm also a proud member of the [Global Voices](http://globalvoices.org/) community, where [I write mostly about digital policy and technology in Bangladesh.](http://globalvoices.org/author/zararahman/) 

In 2016/17, I was a Fellow at [Data & Society Research Institute](http://datasociety.net), where I spent some time thinking about how to really engage people to think critically about data and technology. In the past, I've sat on the Program Committee for [re:publica](https://re-publica.de), and for the [Open Knowledge Festival](https://2014.okfestival.org/), and on the jury for the [Prototype Fund](http://prototypefund.de/).

I enjoy public speaking, debating and writing. I blog semi-regularly on this site, and I sometimes write for other outlets, too.

### before

I've been based in Berlin, Germany for the past seven years, with a year-long stint in New York City in between. I started working in this sector while living in Madrid, Spain in 2010, for [Access Info Europe](https://www.access-info.org/) where I realised the value and importance of accessible information. I was the first employee at [OpenOil](http://openoil.net/), an organisation founded to increase the amount of publicly-available data about the extractive industries in order to improve governance of the sector. Afterwards, I worked at [Open Knowledge International](http://okfn.org/), first as community manager and then as Fellowships Lead for [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/), a global initiative boosting the data literacy skills of journalist and activists.
