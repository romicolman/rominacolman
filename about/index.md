I'm Zara - feminist, researcher and information activist, currently based in New York City. I'm a Fellow at [Data & Society Research Institute](datasociety.net), where I'm looking at the skills and roles needed to successfully implement technology and data projects among human rights defenders and activists. I'm also Research Lead at [The Engine Room](theengineroom.org), where I carry out research to support our work in strengthening the effective use of technology and data in activism and advocacy. I write about digital policy and technology in Bangladesh for [Global Voices.](globalvoices.org/author/zararahman/)

I enjoy public speaking, debating and facilitation. I blog regularly on this site, and I sometimes write for other outlets, too.

I'm normally based in Berlin, Germany, where I've been for more than five years. I've worked in the field of information accessibility and data use among civil society from a number of different angles. I hold British and Bangladeshi nationalities, grew up in the UK, and I speak fluent French, German, Spanish and bits of Arabic and Bengali.

I've worked in over 25 countries around the world, running workshops on topics from data storytelling to contract transparency, carrying out field research, and learning and collaborating with world-changing activists and technology and advocacy organisations.

If you'd like to know more about me, or my work, or if you'd just like to chat, drop me a line on mail[at]zararah.net.
