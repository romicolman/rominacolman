Together with [Lindsay Ferris](https://twitter.com/lindsay_joelle), and as part of my work at [The Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/), I co-authored [this paper on responsible data challenges within the agriculture sector](https://www.theengineroom.org/launching-new-responsible-data-in-agriculture-paper/). We looked particularly at power imbalances within different actors in the sector, and how that translated to their understandings and perceptions of data use.
