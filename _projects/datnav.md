description: A guide on data in human rights

---

Over the course of 2015 and 2016, I coordinated a project with Amnesty International and Benetech as part of my role with The Engine Room, to create a guide on using digital data in human rights research. The guide, DatNav, was the result of months of research and community input which revealed that though using digital data holds many possibilities for detecting human rights violations, knowing where to look and how to start can be overwhelming. In response, we collaboratively created DatNav as a 'navigation guide', through a writing sprint. It was first published in September 2016 and has now been translated into Arabic and Spanish ([all freely available on The Engine Room's site here.](https://www.theengineroom.org/datnav-digital-data-in-human-rights-research/))
