Since late 2015, I've been writing for [Global Voices](https://globalvoices.org/) about digital rights issues in Bangladesh. I started mostly by accident, when the Bangladeshi government banned messaging apps, and I realised that it was getting very little coverage in mainstream media. Since then, I've written about the government's decision [to demand biometric data when anyone wants to register a new SIM card](https://globalvoices.org/2015/12/22/bangladesh-will-demand-biometric-data-from-all-sim-card-users/); the [blocking of news sites in 2016 and testing of 'internet shutdown drills'](https://globalvoices.org/2016/08/04/bangladesh-shuts-down-the-internet-then-orders-blocking-of-35-news-websites/), and developments around ['smart' national identification cards](https://globalvoices.org/2016/10/07/bangladesh-introduces-smart-national-identity-cards/). I keep an eye on ongoing developments in the digital rights space in Bangladesh, and write about it when something newsworthy happens.
