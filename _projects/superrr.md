Since 2015, my friend [Julia Kloiber](http://juliakloiber.com/) and have been organising very informal meetups for women* in Berlin, with no agenda or specific purpose. We hold them in bars and encourage people to bring a new person to the group, so that the network keeps growing - our goal is to provide a friendly space where women* can get together and meet new people, without pressures of networking or having to hold presentations. Superrr meetups have now been held in a few different cities around the world - from Stockholm, to Mexico City and Taiwan.
