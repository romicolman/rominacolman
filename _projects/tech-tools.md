During 2016, the team at [The Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/) and I carried out some research looking into how technology tools were being used by human rights defenders. We wrote [this report about our findings](https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-tools-human-rights/) - and the project itself made me rethink how useful static reports like this are for providing useful information to people looking to make better technology decisions. Almost from the moment of publishing, the report - which included a review of functionalities by different apps and tech tools - was out of date, because naturally, those tools are iterating and releasing new versions on an ongoing basis. I still think there's value in snapshots like this, but now we try to provide more easily updatable outputs from our research projects.
