description: A podcast on tech and power

---

Collusion was a podcast I started with my collaborator [Luiza Prado](http://a-pare.de/), to explore the intersection of technology, colonialism and power. Producing each episode required a lot of research and synthesis â€“ though this is one project I'd love to get back to one day, for now it's on hold! 

Episodes are still [here on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/collusion) and we collated the research and links that informed each episode [on this Tumblr.](http://collusionpodcast.tumblr.com/)

During this project, I realised (yet again) how much of the knowledge I wanted to gain was behind paywalls, and would've cost a lot of money for us to access. Friends were able to give us access to those papers, but the system behind it remains - public money is being used to produce knowledge and learnings that are closed off to the majority of us. To highlight this, we produced a [version of our second episode with the parts that we learned from closed-access papers beeped out](https://soundcloud.com/collusion/episode-2-water-closed-access-version).
