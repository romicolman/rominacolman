I love reading lists, and discovery of new, good books is a problem I'd like to work on more one day.

Over the past few years I've put a few book lists up on this blog, including: [some recommendations from my time at Data & Society](http://zararah.net/blog/2016/11/06/data-and-society-reading-list/), [Postcolonial feminism](http://zararah.net/blog/2014/06/22/postcolonial-feminism-a-reading-list/), [Women tech critics](http://zararah.net/blog/2016/03/13/women-tech-critics/), [books by South African authors](http://zararah.net/blog/2015/12/20/bookworm-south-africa-journey/), [women writers from Central + South America](http://zararah.net/blog/2014/11/14/latin-american-women-writers/), and [books on Bangladesh](http://zararah.net/blog/2013/08/14/bangladesh-my-reading-wishlist/); and annual reviews of books I've been reading â€“ from [2014](http://zararah.net/blog/2014/12/26/50-books-2014/) (a year when I decided to only read books by women), [2015](http://zararah.net/blog/2016/01/02/my-year-in-books/), [2016](http://zararah.net/blog/2017/01/04/2016-in-books/) and [2017](http://zararah.net/blog/2017/12/30/2017-in-books/).
