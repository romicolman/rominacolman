I'm coming up to two months in my fellowship at Data & Society, and I'm trying my best to appreciate it, and not take any of it for granted. The fact that I'm getting paid to read, learn, discuss and debate is still a little bit surreal!

One thing that I have been thinking a lot about is the privileges and the opportunities that the fellowship grants me. Along with the fantastic Data & Society network and community, it's been such a nice break to be assigned reading lists and books in preparation for discussion groups, debates and seminars.

With that in mind - and as someone who thoroughly appreciates when others make curricula public - here's everything that I've been assigned to read over the past two months.

### Books

* [Beamtimes and Lifetimes](https://www.amazon.com/Beamtimes-Lifetimes-World-Energy-Physicists/dp/0674063481), by Sharon Traweek. A study by an anthropologist of the world of high-energy physicists.

* [The Democratic Surround](http://fredturner.stanford.edu/books/the-democratic-surround/), by Fred Turner. This made for a great transition read for me coming from Germany to the United States, though as colleagues at Data & Society pointed out, it does focus heavily on white people, and at some points seems almost dismissive of important issues like the civil rights movements.

* [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815) by Cathy O'Neil. This book just got released, and others at Data & Society wrote [a series of responses to it](https://points.datasociety.net/tagged/wmd) which are also a great read.

* [The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood](https://www.amazon.com/Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235) by James Gleick.

### Articles and stories

* [Race, Class and Gender as Categories of Analysis and Connection](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41680038?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), by Patricia Hills Collins. This has probably been my favourite article so far! It talked a lot about practical issues that I think about a lot.

* [A Theory of Justice](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Justice-John-Rawls/dp/0674000781), by John Rawls - as a non-academic, I have to admit that this was pretty hard to get through. Explanations of it what it was trying to say, though, made a lot of sense to me - but the fact that his arguments around inequality were expressed in (what seemed to me) a highly inaccessible way, came across as highly ironic to me.

* [Generic Processes in the Reproduction of Inequality: an Interactionist Analysis](http://www.soc.iastate.edu/Sapp/Schwalbe.pdf), by Michael Schwalbe et al.

* [The New Atlantis](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-new-atlantis/), by Ursula K. LeGuin. (yep, I'm totally pinching myself that reading and discussing this forms part of what is now my part-time day job...)
