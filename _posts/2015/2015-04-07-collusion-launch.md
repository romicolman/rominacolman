I'm very excited to announce that together with [Luiza Prado](http://a-pare.de/), I'll be co-hosting a new monthly podcast exploring the relationship between power and technology. We've explained a little why we're doing the podcast, and what we hope it will be, in this (very short!) introduction:

We'll be tweeting from [@Collusion_](http://twitter.com/collusion_), and putting episodes up on http://soundcloud.com/collusion, together with links to sources and further material on the topic that we find, and the first full episode will be coming up in late April.

[Get in touch](http://twitter.com/collusion_) if you've got ideas for what we should be reading or looking into!
